# Interactable Objects Example

With these example, you can make any object interactable with differentiated visual state for HoloLens gesture input or immersive headset's motion controller input state. For more information please see ['Interactable Object'](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/interactable_object) on Windows Dev Center.
 
 
### Holographic button ###

This is an example of Holographic button used in the Start menu and App Bar. This example uses Unity's Animation Controller and Animation Clips.

### Mesh button ###

These are the examples using primitives and imported 3D meshes as Interactable Objects. You can easily assign different scale, offset and colors to respond to different input interaction states.


### Traditional button ###

This example shows a traditional 2D style button with some dimension. Each input state has a slightly different depth and animation properties.
 

### Other examples ###

With HoloLens, you can leverage physical space. Imagine a holographic push button on the physical wall. Or how about a coffee cup on the real table? Using 3D models imported from modeling software, we can create Interactable Object that resembles real life object. Since it is digital object, we can add magical interactions to it.
